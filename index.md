_This is an old book written by someone we call Mark, though we don't know Mark's real name.
It is the oldest book that tells the story of the life of Jesus from Nazareth.
(There are older letters that we have about Jesus, but they don't tell the story about Jesus's life.)
It was probably written four tens of years after the events it talks about._

_This book was written in the Greek language.
It has been changed into many other languages, like English.
I have changed an English writing of this book to use only the ten hundred most often used words in English (and also names).
Sometimes, I used words that don't mean exactly what Mark wrote, so that I did not have to stop the story to explain what a thing is.
Sometimes, I was not sure what Mark meant by a word or a couple words.
Both of these things sometimes happen even to people who know Greek, even when they can use all the words in a language._

## Part 1

The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Saver, son of God.

Just like what Isaiah (who spoke Godâ€™s truth) said:

> Look! I am sending someone with a message in front of you who will prepare your way.
> A voice crying out in the wild places:
> "Prepare the owner's way! Make his paths straight!"

John came, putting people under water
<small>
The Jews (Jesus's people) follow many laws.
If you wanted to go to God's house, you had to let a God-worker put you under water first; then you would be clean enough.
Other people who wrote about Jesus say that John's father was a God-worker.
Sons of God-workers were God-workers, but John was not a normal one.
</small>
in a wild place,
and told people about being put under water and changing to get rid of bad acts.
People from all over Judea (even from Jerusalem) went out to him,
and he put them in the Jordan and they admitted what they had done wrong.
John wore clothing made from animal hair, an animal-skin ring around his middle,
and he ate tiny flying animals and wild sweet stuff from other tiny flying animals.
He said "A stronger person than me is coming after me, and I am not good enough to tie his shoes.
I washed you in water, but he will wash you in God's Spirit."

Immediately, the Spirit sent Jesus into a wild place.
He stayed there for many days, and Satan
<small>
The name Satan just means "The One Against Us" in Hebrew.
There is a bad spirit called Satan that shows up two times in the main books about God that the Jews read.
</small>
tried to make him do bad things.
He was with the wild animals, and message-holders from God helped him.

Now, after John was locked up, Jesus came to Galilee, talking about the good news of God, and saying
"The time is right, and God's country is getting close. Change your life, and trust the good news."

When Jesus walked by the little sea Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew,
who were putting fish screens in the little sea, because they were fish-catchers.
And Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you person-catchers!"
They immediately dropped their fish screens and followed him.
As he went a little farther, he saw James (son of Zebedee), and his brother John,
who were in their boat, fixing their fish screens.
Immediately, he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the workers and followed him.

They went to Capernaum, and when the resting day
<small>One of the laws that Jews follow says that they have to rest on Saturdays.</small>
came, he entered the church and taught.
They were surprised by his teaching, because he taught them like someone who had power,
not like the people who thought about the law.
Just then, there was someone in the church who had a sick spirit, and he yelled,
"What's your business with us, Jesus from Nazareth? Have you come to wipe us out? I know who you are, God's good person!"
But Jesus yelled at him, saying "Shut up and come out of him!"
And making him shake and cry with a loud voice, the sick spirit came out of him.
They were surprised, and kept asking each other,
"What is this? A new teaching, but with power? He orders the sick spirits around and they do what he says."
And word about this spread through the whole space around Galilee.

As soon as they left the church, they went to Simon and Andrew's house, with James and John.
Simon's mother-in-law was sick in bed, and they immediately told Jesus about her.
He came and took her hand and lifted her up, and she got well right away, and got up and gave them food.
When it was getting dark, they brought him everyone who was sick or who had a bad spirit.
The whole town was at the door!
And Jesus helped many people who were sick with different things, and he sent away many sick spirits,
which he didn't allow to speak, since they knew him.

In the morning, when it was still very dark, he got up and went away from town and talked to God.
Simon and his friends looked around for him.
When they found him, they said "Everyone is searching for you!"
He answered, "Let's go to towns that are near so that I may give them my message also, since that's what I came out to do."
And he went around, talking in churches around there, and getting rid of sick spirits.

Someone with bad skin came to Jesus, got on his knees, and said "If you want, you can make me clean."
Jesus felt bad for him, and touched him, saying "I do want to: be clean."
Immediately, his skin got better, and he was clean.
Jesus sent him away, saying in a serious tone,
"Make sure not to say anything to anyone, but show the God-worker and kill the animals for God,
the way that Moses said you should when you become clean."
But the man went off and talked very much and spread the word,
so Jesus could no longer go to town if people knew about it,
but he had to stay in the open spaces.
People came to him from every direction!

## Part 2

Jesus came back to Capernaum, and after some days, people heard that he was at home.
There were so many people around him, that there was no room in the house, or even near the front door.
Four people came, bringing a man who could not move.
They couldn't get to Jesus through the crowd, so they made a hole in the roof above him,
and let the man down on the little bed they carried him with.
Seeing how much they trusted him, Jesus said, "Child, the bad things you have done are gone."
But some of the people who thought about the law were sitting there, and they thought:
"Why does he talk like this? He lies; who can get rid of bad acts but God?".
At once, Jesus knew that they were talking about these questions, and he said to them,
"Which is easier to say to someone who can't move: 'The bad things you have done are gone',
or 'Stand, take your bed, and walk'?
But so you can know that The Human
<small>
Jesus used "The Human" to talk about himself.
Probably, when people heard it, they would remember a time when Daniel (a great old Jewish person)
said he saw God on a big chair on fire give the world to "one who looked like a human".
</small>
has the right to get rid of bad acts on earth--"
he said to the man who could not move,
"I tell you, stand up, take your bed, and go to your home!"
And he got up, and immediately took his little bed, and went out in front of everyone.
They were surprised and said God was great, and said "We've never seen anything like this!"

Jesus went out again beside the little sea, and the whole crowd gathered around him, and he taught them.
As he walked along, he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting in his fee-taker's office,and he said to him, "Follow me."
And he got up and followed him.

And as he ate dinner at Levi's, many fee-takers and bad-thing-doers
were also sitting with Jesus and his students -- because many people followed him.
When some of the Pharisees
<small>
Some Jews were Pharisees.
The Pharisees believed that it was important for the Jews to keep following the laws that made them Jewish,
and to avoid becoming like the Romans who now owned their land.
They were liked by lower-class people.
Many people probably saw Jesus as a Pharisee because he was very much like them.
That is probably why Jesus talks to them so much.
</small>
who thought about the law saw that he was eating with the fee-takers and bad-thing-doers,
they said to his students, "Why does he eat with them?".
When Jesus heard this, he said to them,
"People who are well don't need a doctor, only people who are sick;
I didn't come to call the good people, but the bad-thing-doers."

Now John's students and the Pharisees were not eating.
<small>The Pharisees didn't eat on Mondays and Thursdays. Not eating was a sign of being sad.</small>
People said to Jesus, "Why is it that John's students and the Pharisees do not eat, but your students do?".
Jesus said to them, "The wedding party eats while the husband-to-be is with them, don't they?
As long as he is with them, they cannot avoid eating.
But days will come when he is taken away from them, and on that day, they will not eat.

"No one fixes an old piece of clothing with new clothing-pieces that have not gotten smaller from washing it yet;
if they did, the new piece would pull away from it, and leave a worse hole.
And no one puts new wine into old wine bags; if they did, the wine will break the wine bag, and the wine will be lost.
Instead, one puts new wine into new wine bags."

On the resting day, Jesus was walking through the fields of growing food,
and as they walked, his students took bits of the food.
The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing something against the law on the resting day?"
And he said to them, "Didn't you read what David did when he and the people with him needed food?
He entered God's house (when Abiathar was the highest God-worker),
and ate the food that was in front of God, which may not be eaten, except by the God-workers.
He even gave some to the people with him."
Then he said, "The resting day was made for people, not people for the resting day.
So the The Human is owner of the resting day, even!"

## Part 3

Jesus went back to church, and there was a man with a bad hand.
They watched to see if Jesus would fix him on the resting day, so that they could say that he broke the law.
To the man with the bad hand, he said, "Stand up in the middle."
Then he said, "Is it okay with the law to do good or to do bad things on the resting day? To save life or to kill?"
But they were silent.
He looked at them and was mad; he was sad about their hard hearts.
He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was fixed.
The Pharisees went out and immediately talked with Herod's
<small>Herod was the leader of the land Jesus was from;
his father had built God's house (after it had been torn down).
Herod was allowed to be the leader by the Romans.
He didn't seem to care much about the Jewish laws.</small>
people about how to kill him.

Jesus went with his students to the little sea, and a lot of people from Galilee followed him,
along with many people (who heard what he was doing) from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea,
the other side of the Jordan River, and the places around Tyre and Sidon.
He told his students to have a boat ready, so that they wouldn't crowd around him,
because he had fixed many sick people, so everyone who was sick wanted to touch him.
When the sick spirits saw him, they fell down in front of him, and said, "You are the Son of God!"
But he told them in a serious tone to not tell about him.

Jesus went up to the mountain and called the people he wanted, and they came to him.
He picked ten and two, whom he called message-carriers, to be with him,
and to be sent out to tell people the message, and to throw out bad spirits.
So he picked the ten and two: Simon (whom he called Peter
<small>The name Peter just means "Rock".</small>
), James (son of Zebedee) and John the brother of James (whom he called Boanerges, which means "Sons of Loud Sky Sounds"),
and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James (son of Alphaeus),
and Thaddaeus, and Simon (from Cana), and Judas Iscariot, who would sell Jesus out.

Then he went home, and the crowd came together again, so that they couldn't even eat.
When his family heard about it, they went to hold him back, because people were saying, "He has lost his mind."
And the people who think about the law who came from Jerusalem said
"He has Beelzebul, and with the power of the leader of bad spirits, he throws the bad spirits out."
And he called out to them, and spoke to them in word pictures, saying,
"How can the Satan throw itself out?
And if a country fights itself, that country cannot stand.
And if a house fights itself, it will not be possible for that house to stand.
And if Satan stood up against itself and is broken into two, it will not stand, but it has come to an end.
But no one can come into a strong man's house and steal his things, without first tying up the strong man; then the house can be stolen from.

"This is the truth: all the bad things humans have done and all the bad lies tell will be wiped away.
But anyone who lies against the Good Spirit will keep their bad acts, and has done a bad thing that does not end."
â€” this was because they were saying he had a sick spirit.

Then Jesus' mother and brothers came and stood outside and sent for him.
And the crowd sitting around him said, "You mother and your brothers and sisters are outside, asking for you."
And he replied, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"
Looking around at the people who sat around him in a circle, he said,
"Here are my mother and my brothers! Anyone who does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother."

## Part 4

Again, Jesus began to teach next to the little sea.
Such a huge crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the sea and sat there, and the crowd was near the sea on land.
He taught them with word pictures, like this one,
"Listen! A person who grows food went out to throw some tiny starters to the ground to grow into food.
As the starters were thrown, some of them fell on a foot path, and were eaten by birds.
Others fell on not-very-deep dirt with rocks.
The starters grew up a little very quickly because the dirt was not deep.
But they burned under the hot sun, and died because they didn't go deep into the ground.
 Others fell in pointy things that grew and crowded them before they got strong so they made no food.
Still others fell on good earth and gave thirty or twice that or even a hundred times as much food."
Then he said, "Anyone with ears to hear should hear!"

When Jesus was alone, the ten and two, along with the people around him, asked about the word pictures.
He replied, "You are allowed to know the hidden things about God's country,
but to outside people, everything becomes word pictures.
You know, 'when they see, they will see but not understand, and when they hear,
they will hear but not understand â€” if they did, they might change, and their bad acts would be gone!'"
<small>
People listening to this would have been reminded of a time that Isaiah said something like this.
</small>

Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this word picture? Then how will you understand all the word pictures?
The person who grows food is growing the word.
The starters that fell beside the path: where the word is thrown to grow,
when those people who hear it, Satan comes immediately and takes the word that they got.
The starters that were thrown on dirt with rocks:
those are the people who immediately receive the word and are happy about it, but they don't have any hold on the ground;
then when bad things happen to them or they get into trouble because of the word, they immediately fall away.


"And others are the ones that got thrown among pointy things: these are the ones that heard the word,
but the worries of the world and the wanting of money and for everything else come around and press around the word and it makes no food.
And there are the starters that were thrown on good earth,
who hear the word and take it and give food: thirty or twice that or one hundred times as much food."

And Jesus said to them,
"Is a light brought to be put under a big cup or under a bed, and not on a table?
There isn't anything hidden that won't be revealed, and nothing hidden away that won't come into the open.
Anyone with ears to hear should hear!"

And he also said, "God's country is like someone throwing starters onto the earth,
who sleeps and wakes up night and day while the starters come out of the earth and grow, but they don't understand how.
On its own, the earth gives first the thin part, then the big part, then the food in the big part.
But when the field is ready, they get out the field-knife, because it is time to bring the food in."

And he also said,
"What should we say God's country is like? What word picture should we use for it?
It is like a food starter thrown on the earth.
Even though it's the smallest of them all, when it is thrown on the ground, it grows up and becomes the biggest grown food,
and makes branches so the birds of the air can make their homes where it blocks the sun."

With many word pictures like that, he told them the word, as they could hear it.
He didn't say anything except in word pictures, but alone with his students, he explained everything.

On that day, when it was close to night, he said "Let's go to the other side." And leaving the crowd, they took him in the boat, just the way he was.
Other boats were with him.
And there was a huge wind and the waves hit the boat so that it was already getting full of water.
But Jesus was sleeping on a soft thing in the back of the boat.
They woke him up and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care that we're going to die?"
And, waking up, he told the wind off and said to the little sea, "Be still! Be silent!"
Then the wind died away and everything was calm.
And Jesus said to them, "Why are you afraid? Do you still not have trust?"
And they were struck with wonder and fear and said to each other, "Who is this, that even the wind and the sea follow his orders?"
