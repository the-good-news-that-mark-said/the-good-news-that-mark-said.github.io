_This is an old book written by someone we call Mark, though we don't know Mark's real name.
It is the oldest book that tells the story of the life of Jesus from Nazareth.
(There are older letters that we have about Jesus, but they don't tell the story about Jesus's life.)
It was probably written four tens of years after the events it talks about._

_This book was written in the Greek language.
It has been changed into many other languages, like English.
I have changed an English writing of this book to use only the ten hundred most often used words in English (and also names).
Sometimes, I used words that don't mean exactly what Mark wrote, so that I did not have to stop the story to explain what a thing is.
Sometimes, I was not sure what Mark meant by a word or a couple words.
Both of these things sometimes happen even to people who know Greek, even when they can use all the words in a language._

## Part 1

The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Saver, son of God.

Just like what Isaiah (who spoke Godâ€™s truth) said:

> Look! I am sending someone with a message in front of you who will prepare your way.  
> A voice crying out in the wild places:  
> "Prepare the owner's way! Make his paths straight!"   
     
John came, putting people under water[^under] in a wild place,
and told people about being put under water and changing to get rid of bad acts.
People from all over Judea (even from Jerusalem) went out to him,
and he put them in the Jordan and they admitted what they had done wrong.
John wore clothing made from animal hair, an animal-skin ring around his middle, 
and he ate tiny flying animals and wild sweet stuff from other tiny flying animals.
He said "A stronger person than me is coming after me, and I am not good enough to tie his shoes.
I washed you in water, but he will wash you in God's Spirit."

[^under]: The Jews (Jesus's people) follow many laws.
  If you wanted to go to God's house, you had to let a God-worker put you under water first; then you would be clean enough.
  Other people who wrote about Jesus say that John's father was a God-worker.
  Sons of God-workers were God-workers, but John was not a normal one.
  
Immediately, the Spirit sent Jesus into a wild place.
He stayed there for many days, and Satan[^satan] tried to make him do bad things.
He was with the wild animals, and message-holders from God helped him.

[^satan]: The name Satan just means "The One Against Us" in Hebrew.
  There is a bad spirit called Satan that shows up two times in the main books about God that the Jews read.

Now, after John was locked up, Jesus came to Galilee, talking about the good news of God, and saying
"The time is right, and God's country is getting close. Change your life, and trust the good news."

When Jesus walked by the little sea Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew,
who were putting fish screens in the little sea, because they were fish-catchers.
And Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you person-catchers!"
They immediately dropped their fish screens and followed him.
As he went a little farther, he saw James (son of Zebedee), and his brother John,
who were in their boat, fixing their fish screens.
Immediately, he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the workers and followed him.

They went to Capernaum, and when the resting day<aside>One of the laws that Jews follow says that they have to rest on Saturdays.</aside>
came, he entered the church and taught.
They were surprised by his teaching, because he taught them like someone who had power,
not like the people who thought about the law.
Just then, there was someone in the church who had a sick spirit, and he yelled,
"What's your business with us, Jesus from Nazareth? Have you come to wipe us out? I know who you are, God's good person!"
But Jesus yelled at him, saying "Shut up and come out of him!"
And making him shake and cry with a loud voice, the sick spirit came out of him.
They were surprised, and kept asking each other, 
"What is this? A new teaching, but with power? He orders the sick spirits around and they do what he says."
And word about this spread through the whole space around Galilee.

As soon as they left the church, they went to Simon and Andrew's house, with James and John.
Simon's mother-in-law was sick in bed, and they immediately told Jesus about her.
He came and took her hand and lifted her up, and she got well right away, and got up and gave them food.
When it was getting dark, they brought him everyone who was sick or who had a bad spirit.
The whole town was at the door!
And Jesus helped many people who were sick with different things, and he sent away many sick spirits,
which he didn't allow to speak, since they knew him.

In the morning, when it was still very dark, he got up and went away from town and talked to God.
Simon and his friends looked around for him.
When they found him, they said "Everyone is searching for you!"
He answered, "Let's go to towns that are near so that I may give them my message also, since that's what I came out to do."
And he went around, talking in churches around there, and getting rid of sick spirits.

Someone with bad skin came to Jesus, got on his knees, and said "If you want, you can make me clean."
Jesus felt bad for him, and touched him, saying "I do want to: be clean."
Immediately, his skin got better, and he was clean.
Jesus sent him away, saying in a serious tone,
"Make sure not to say anything to anyone, but show the God-worker and kill the animals for God,
the way that Moses said you should when you become clean."
But the man went off and talked very much and spread the word, 
so Jesus could no longer go to town if people knew about it,
but he had to stay in the open spaces.
People came to him from every direction!
