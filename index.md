_This is an old book written by someone we call Mark, though we don't know Mark's real name.
It is the oldest book that tells the story of the life of Jesus from Nazareth.
(There are older letters that we have about Jesus, but they don't tell the story about Jesus's life.)
It was probably written four tens of years after the events it talks about._

_This book was written in the Greek language.
It has been changed into many other languages, like English.
I have changed an English writing of this book to use only the ten hundred most often used words in English (and also names).
Sometimes, I used words that don't mean exactly what Mark wrote, so that I did not have to stop the story to explain what a thing is.
Sometimes, I was not sure what Mark meant by a word or a couple words.
Both of these things sometimes happen even to people who know Greek, even when they can use all the words in a language._

## Part 1

The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Saver, son of God.

Just like what Isaiah (who spoke Godâ€™s truth) said:

> Look! I am sending someone with a message in front of you who will prepare your way.
> A voice crying out in the wild places:
> "Prepare the owner's way! Make his paths straight!"

John came, putting people under water
<small>
The Jews (Jesus's people) follow many laws.
If you wanted to go to God's house, you had to let a God-worker put you under water first; then you would be clean enough.
Other people who wrote about Jesus say that John's father was a God-worker.
Sons of God-workers were God-workers, but John was not a normal one.
</small>
in a wild place,
and told people about being put under water and changing to get rid of bad acts.
People from all over Judea (even from Jerusalem) went out to him,
and he put them in the Jordan and they admitted what they had done wrong.
John wore clothing made from animal hair, an animal-skin ring around his middle,
and he ate tiny flying animals and wild sweet stuff from other tiny flying animals.
He said "A stronger person than me is coming after me, and I am not good enough to tie his shoes.
I washed you in water, but he will wash you in God's Spirit."

Immediately, the Spirit sent Jesus into a wild place.
He stayed there for many days, and Satan
<small>
The name Satan just means "The One Against Us" in Hebrew.
There is a bad spirit called Satan that shows up two times in the main books about God that the Jews read.
</small>
tried to make him do bad things.
He was with the wild animals, and message-holders from God helped him.

Now, after John was locked up, Jesus came to Galilee, talking about the good news of God, and saying
"The time is right, and God's country is getting close. Change your life, and trust the good news."

When Jesus walked by the little sea Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew,
who were putting fish screens in the little sea, because they were fish-catchers.
And Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you person-catchers!"
They immediately dropped their fish screens and followed him.
As he went a little farther, he saw James (son of Zebedee), and his brother John,
who were in their boat, fixing their fish screens.
Immediately, he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the workers and followed him.

They went to Capernaum, and when the resting day
<small>One of the laws that Jews follow says that they have to rest on Saturdays.</small>
came, he entered the church and taught.
They were surprised by his teaching, because he taught them like someone who had power,
not like the people who thought about the law.
Just then, there was someone in the church who had a sick spirit, and he yelled,
"What's your business with us, Jesus from Nazareth? Have you come to wipe us out? I know who you are, God's good person!"
But Jesus yelled at him, saying "Shut up and come out of him!"
And making him shake and cry with a loud voice, the sick spirit came out of him.
They were surprised, and kept asking each other,
"What is this? A new teaching, but with power? He orders the sick spirits around and they do what he says."
And word about this spread through the whole space around Galilee.

As soon as they left the church, they went to Simon and Andrew's house, with James and John.
Simon's mother-in-law was sick in bed, and they immediately told Jesus about her.
He came and took her hand and lifted her up, and she got well right away, and got up and gave them food.
When it was getting dark, they brought him everyone who was sick or who had a bad spirit.
The whole town was at the door!
And Jesus helped many people who were sick with different things, and he sent away many sick spirits,
which he didn't allow to speak, since they knew him.

In the morning, when it was still very dark, he got up and went away from town and talked to God.
Simon and his friends looked around for him.
When they found him, they said "Everyone is searching for you!"
He answered, "Let's go to towns that are near so that I may give them my message also, since that's what I came out to do."
And he went around, talking in churches around there, and getting rid of sick spirits.

Someone with bad skin came to Jesus, got on his knees, and said "If you want, you can make me clean."
Jesus felt bad for him, and touched him, saying "I do want to: be clean."
Immediately, his skin got better, and he was clean.
Jesus sent him away, saying in a serious tone,
"Make sure not to say anything to anyone, but show the God-worker and kill the animals for God,
the way that Moses said you should when you become clean."
But the man went off and talked very much and spread the word,
so Jesus could no longer go to town if people knew about it,
but he had to stay in the open spaces.
People came to him from every direction!

## Part 2

Jesus came back to Capernaum, and after some days, people heard that he was at home.
There were so many people around him, that there was no room in the house, or even near the front door.
Four people came, bringing a man who could not move.
They couldn't get to Jesus through the crowd, so they made a hole in the roof above him,
and let the man down on the little bed they carried him with.
Seeing how much they trusted him, Jesus said, "Child, the bad things you have done are gone."
But some of the people who thought about the law were sitting there, and they thought:
"Why does he talk like this? He lies; who can get rid of bad acts but God?".
At once, Jesus knew that they were talking about these questions, and he said to them,
"Which is easier to say to someone who can't move: 'The bad things you have done are gone',
or 'Stand, take your bed, and walk'?
But so you can know that The Human has the right to get rid of bad acts on earth--"
he said to the man who could not move,
"I tell you, stand up, take your bed, and go to your home!"
And he got up, and immediately took his little bed, and went out in front of everyone.
They were surprised and said God was great, and said "We've never seen anything like this!"

Jesus went out again beside the little sea, and the whole crowd gathered around him, and he taught them.
As he walked along, he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting in his fee-taker's office,and he said to him, "Follow me."
And he got up and followed him.

And as he ate dinner at Levi's, many fee-takers and bad-thing-doers
were also sitting with Jesus and his students -- because many people followed him.
When some of the Pharisees
<small>
Some Jews were Pharisees.
The Pharisees believed that it was important for the Jews to keep following the laws that made them Jewish,
and to avoid becoming like the Romans who now owned their land.
They were liked by lower-class people.
Many people probably saw Jesus as a Pharisee because he was very much like them.
That is probably why Jesus talks to them so much.
</small>
who thought about the law saw that he was eating with the fee-takers and bad-thing-doers,
they said to his students, "Why does he eat with them?".
When Jesus heard this, he said to them,
"People who are well don't need a doctor, only people who are sick;
I didn't come to call the good people, but the bad-thing-doers."

Now John's students and the Pharisees were not eating.
People said to Jesus, "Why is it that John's students and the Pharisees do not eat, but your students do?".
Jesus said to them, "The wedding party eats while the husband-to-be is with them, don't they?
As long as he is with them, they cannot avoid eating.
But days will come when he is taken away from them, and on that day, they will not eat.

"No one fixes an old piece of clothing with new clothing-pieces that have not gotten smaller from washing it yet;
if they did, the new piece would pull away from it, and leave a worse hole.
And no one puts new wine into old wine bags; if they did, the wine will break the wine bag, and the wine will be lost.
Instead, one puts new wine into new wine bags."

On the resting day, Jesus was walking through the fields of growing food,
and as they walked, his students took bits of the food.
The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing something against the law on the resting day?"
And he said to them, "Didn't you read what David did when he and the people with him needed food?
He entered God's house (when Abiathar was the highest God-worker),
and ate the food that was in front of God, which may not be eaten, except by the God-workers.
He even gave some to the people with him."
Then he said, "The resting day was made for people, not people for the resting day.
So the The Human is owner of the resting day, even!"
